    <h2>Pre-story</h2>

    <p class="narration">
      The world was submerged in the ocean in 2097 and Among the 15.6 Billion -
      only 16.3 million of the world's population survived. The world has
      changed a lot since the great flood of 2097. After the catastrophe,
      humanity had to adapt to new ways of living, and one of the most
      significant changes was the construction of Hydronova, the largest fully
      equipped battleship city ever built. The Hydronova is a marvel of modern
      engineering,
    </p>

    <h2>Currently in 2205 - Present!</h2>

    <p class="narration">
      You see all the planes flying around to celebrate the 155th anniversary
      after the world sank. Almost everyone has a happy face, except for the few
      old geezers who know how bad the catastrophe was back then in time because
      they had experienced it themselves.
    </p>

    <p class="narration">
      As celebrations were in full swing, we could see a group of 12-14 people
      starting to surround the Hydronova from around.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p>
        <strong>Agent 1:</strong> Man, I wish I could take the time off to enjoy
        the view of celebrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Agent 2:</strong> I feel you, but it is our responsibility to
        keep the insides safe from the deep sea dangers.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Agent 1:</strong> I know that, but still… nevermind.</p>

    <p class="action">The view for the sector 33 camera feed gets cut off.</p>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p>
        <strong>Agent 2:</strong> Betsy, look at this, the feed got cut off just
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Agent 1:</strong> What! Are you kidding? Those cameras are
        guarded by a bullet-proof shield, even your most talented Titan will
        have a hard time trying to break it, even if someone tries to break it
        by force, we would see them in the recorded feed. Check the previous
        feed before it was cut off.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Agent 2:</strong> I was checking the same while you were nagging
        me, but I didn’t see anyone come near to the base from the below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Betsy:</strong> This sounds like trouble for us, Andre. Let's go
        out and check if we can see something through our Radeon Glasses.
      </p>

    <p class="action">
      Betsy and Andre came out of the Guard Station, they were looking down at
      the exact spot, but they couldn’t see anything.

      Suddenly they feel a presence in front of them, and before they can even

    </div>

    <!-- <p class="narration">
    Rogue Sky, the most wanted criminal in the world, is a former special forces
    agent who turned rogue after a mission gone wrong. Known for his tactical
    genius and unparalleled combat skills, Rogue Sky has been orchestrating
    high-profile heists and sabotage operations against mega-corporations and
    governments alike. His motives are shrouded in mystery, but whispers of a
    personal vendetta and a desire to expose corruption run rampant. With a
    loyal team of operatives at his side, Rogue Sky remains elusive, always
    staying one step ahead of law enforcement and bounty hunters. His signature
    look includes a sleek, black tactical suit with a high-tech visor that
    enhances his vision and provides real-time data analysis during missions.

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><strong>Rogue:</strong> Make it fast, we don’t have much time.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Team Member:</strong> Yes, Captain. But why are you on Sector
        33? The plan was to hit Sector 87 first, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rogue:</strong> Change of plans. Sector 33 has the main control
        hub for the entire the Hydronova. Taking it out will cripple their
        defenses and create chaos, and had a lot people - so I got rid of them
        all at once. I am heading to the ice pod storage next in Sector 67, and
        i'll meet you there, Rody.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Rody:</strong> Understood, Captain. See you in a bit.</p>
