  <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
  <h1 id="chapters-title">Awake from the Slumber</h1>
  <h2>Pre-story</h2>

  <p class="narration">
    The world had drowned in 2097. Of the 15.6 billion alive before the Great
    Flood, only 16.3 million of the world's population survived. Humanity had
    clawed its way back, forging a new life atop the ocean. The crowning
    achievement of this era was <strong>The Hydronova</strong>—the largest fully
    equipped battleship city ever built, a fortress of steel and technology
    floating on the endless waves. The Hydronova was a marvel of modern
    engineering—almost as large as New York City and Hundred floors high (400m) and twenty stories under the ocean.
  </p>

  <h2>Currently in 2205 - Present!</h2>

  <p class="narration">
    The four Hydronova's - mega stations ruled the seas. Today, they celebrated the
    <strong>155th anniversary of the world’s rebirth</strong>. Skies buzzed with
    planes streaking across neon clouds, and streets glimmered with lights and loud fireworks and drone-shows.
    Almost everyone wore a smile—except for the few old geezers sitting at the top of the observatory station who remembered
    how bad the catastrophe was back then, in the time of the flood and the
    horrors it had washed away.
  </p>

  <p class="narration">
    Through the celebrations, with far more light spilling over the ocean than
    usual, a Drift of <strong>Luminox</strong> began to emerge beneath
    Hydronova—massive creatures drawn to the light. we could see a total of 12-14 people starting to surround the Mega station from around. 

  </p>

  <p class="narration">
    The top of Hydronova consisted of <strong>180 sectors</strong>—the summit of
    the city, housing all the major technological and medical research labs.
  </p>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p>
      <strong>Agent 1:</strong> Man, I wish I could take the time off to enjoy
      the view of the celebrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Agent 2:</strong> I feel you, but it’s our responsibility to keep
      the researchers safe from the deep-sea dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Agent 1:</strong> I know… still, a little view wouldn’t hurt—never
      mind.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p class="narration">
    Suddenly, the feed from Sector 33 flickered, then cut entirely.
  </p>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p>
      <strong>Agent 2:</strong> Betsy, look at this—the feed just went dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Betsy:</strong> What! Are you kidding? Those cameras are guarded
      by a missileproof shield. Even your biggest Luminox would have a hard time
      breaking it. If someone forced it, we’d see it on the recorded feed. Check
      it—now!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Agent 2:</strong> I was checking that while you were nagging me,
      but I didn’t see anyone approach the base from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Betsy:</strong> This sounds like trouble for us, Andre. Sound the
      alarms and let’s go check it out through our Radeon Glasses.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p class="action">
    Betsy and Andre stepped out of the Command Post. They looked down at the
    exact spot, but there was nothing. Then—a presence.

    Before they could even lift their heads, they were decapitated. As their
    heads hit the surface, a figure landed gracefully beside the lifeless
    guards. The slash had torn through them both—along with 267 civilians behind
    their post. Blood sprayed across the corridor, painting Sector 33 in a
    crimson storm. With the people sliced apart and the splattering of blood, it
    began to look as if it were raining blood.

    <p><strong>Person:</strong> Sector 33 secured. Report!</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Team Member:</strong> Our team members are heading to the other
      sectors. We should start getting in about five minutes, Captain Rogue.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Rogue:</strong> Make it three. We don’t have much time.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Team Member:</strong> Yes, Captain. But why are you at Sector 33?
      The plan was to hit Sector 87 first, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rogue:</strong> Change of plans. Sector 33 houses the Hydronova’s
      core systems. Taking it out will cripple their defenses and create chaos.
      And it had a lot of people—so I got rid of them all at once.
    </p>

    She inserted a sleek, high-tech device—the <strong>Paradox</strong>—into the
    floating console. The holographic interface flickered, then yielded within
    seconds.

      <strong>Rogue:</strong> I’m heading to the ice pod storage next, in Sector
      67. I’ll meet you there, Rody.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Rody:</strong> Understood, Captain. See you in a bit.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="scene-divider"></div>

  <p class="narration">
    Explosions erupted across every sector at once, shaking the entire summit of the 
    Hydronova. Alarms screamed through the corridors—so loud they drowned out
    even the emergency broadcasts. Researchers monitoring the outer-space
    footage froze mid-communication, panic setting in, before abandoning their
    posts and rushing down toward the lower decks. Meanwhile, soldiers were
    already mobilizing, heading for the summit to intercept the invaders.
  </p>

  <p class="action">
    Rogue began rampaging, tearing through every sector on her path to Sector
    67, leaving only blood rain in her wake.
  </p>

  <p class="narration">
    She reached the destination in 1 minute 30 seconds, covering a distance of
    270 kilometers—and leaving 3,897 dead. Civilian workers, guards—none
    survived her dual gratinum swords, sharp enough to slice through a mini
    hydrogen bomb-resistant door.
  </p>

  <p class="action">
    She was greeted with one such door—a fortress of reinforced gratinum alloy.
    With a single swing, her twin blades sliced it in half.
  </p>

  <p class="narration">
    Inside, after killing everyone, she inserted the Paradox into the floating
    table, projecting a hologram over a massive ice chamber. The system,
    designed to preserve the subject in perfect suspension, began to thaw.

    <p>
      <strong>Rogue:</strong> I’m in. The ice is melting. Where are you, Rody?

    <p><strong>Rody:</strong> Me and Remy—thirty seconds out.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rogue:</strong> Thanks to the Professor, everything’s going
      according to plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rody:</strong> Xenon said there was a hiccup, but he and the
      others handled it. They’ll be here in three minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rogue:</strong> Good. We should be gone before the Kaedros even
      realize we’re here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Remy:</strong> Even if they do, it’ll take them twenty to
      twenty-five minutes from the outer space orbit.

    As the ice melted, a man emerged—appearing to be in his thirties. His
    stance—left leg forward, right bent—frozen mid-swing, clutching a wooden
    stick.

    The ice cracked. The chamber tilted downward. Power surged through his

    Hydronova—a semi-circular city spanning 377 square kilometers—and triggered

    At the tip of the severed edge, the man fell to his knees, dizzy. Sparks
    burst around him. Fireworks flared in the distance. Behind him, the
