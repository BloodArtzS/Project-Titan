  <h1>The Start</h1>

  <p>
    The three you see above are the best stories I have witnessed in my entire
    life, and I believe anybody who watches them would feel the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    I used to belittle my friends, saying that anime was for kids, joking about
    it, and never really even looking into it.
  </p>

  <p>
    One day, we bunked our class and were roaming around in our college when I
    saw my friend watching <strong>Attack on Titan</strong>. I was really
    intrigued after watching only 10 minutes of the episode.
  </p>

  <p>
    And that was only the start. I watched all three seasons of the show in 3 days and
    even went on to read the entire manga, following all the new chapters as
    they were released until the very end.
  </p>

  <p>
    I then started watching other popular anime as well, like
    <strong>Naruto</strong> and <strong>Demon Slayer</strong>. Around this time,
    I got into <strong>Manhwa</strong>, and that led me to
    <strong>Solo Leveling</strong> and <strong>Nano Machine</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I waited a long time to watch <strong>One Piece</strong> because I am the
    type of person who doesnâ€™t like to stop anything in the middle. In December
    2024, I finally started watching <strong>One Piece</strong> and finished it.
    As you might have guessed, I finished the manga as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    After watching <strong>One Piece</strong>, I had a serious of adrenaline rush,
    and then I had all the manuscripts until then destroyed and restarted the whole story.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reason I started this story? One day, one of my friends encouraged me to
    explore new ways to keep myself occupied, and that was it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started the initial manuscript in <strong>March 2023</strong> and began
    working on this website in <strong>September 2024</strong>. Hopefully, I
    want to publish this to the public in <strong>2025</strong> and be active on
    social media as part of my studio.
