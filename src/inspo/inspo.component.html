      <h3><strong>Attack on Titan</strong><br /></h3>
      <p>
        Attack on Titan is an anime series that follows the story of humanity's
        struggle against giant humanoid creatures known as Titans. The series is
        set in a world where humanity lives behind three massive walls to
        protect themselves from these Titans, who are immune to almost all forms
        of attack except for a vulnerable spot at the nape of their necks.

          The three you see above are the best stories I have witnessed in my
          entire life, and I believe anybody who watches them would feel the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to belittle my friends, saying that anime was for kids, joking
          about it, and never really even looking into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, we bunked our class and were roaming around in our college
          when I saw my friend watching <strong>Attack on Titan</strong>. I was
          really intrigued after watching only 10 minutes of the episode.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that was only the start. I watched all three seasons of the show
          in 3 days and even went on to read the entire manga, following all the
          new chapters as they were released until the very end.
        </p>

        <p>
          I then started watching other popular anime as well, like
          <strong>Naruto</strong> and <strong>Demon Slayer</strong>. Around this
          time, I got into <strong>Manhwa</strong>, and that led me to
          <strong>Solo Leveling</strong> and <strong>Nano Machine</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I waited a long time to watch <strong>One Piece</strong> because I am
          the type of person who doesnâ€™t like to stop anything in the middle. In
          December 2024, I finally started watching
          <strong>One Piece</strong> and finished it. As you might have guessed,
          I finished the manga as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          After watching <strong>One Piece</strong>, I had a serious of
          adrenaline rush, and then I had all the manuscripts until then
          destroyed and restarted the whole story.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason I started this story? One day, one of my friends encouraged
          me to explore new ways to keep myself occupied, and that was it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started the initial manuscript in <strong>March 2023</strong> and
          began working on this website in <strong>September 2024</strong>.
          Hopefully, I want to publish this to the public in
          <strong>2025</strong> and be active on social media as part of my
          studio.
